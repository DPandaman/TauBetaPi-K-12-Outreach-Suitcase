# TauBetaPi 2024 K-12 Outreach Project:

### Project Overview:

Beginner's Level:

The overall goal of this outreach event was to create a set of puzzle activites that students could solve in small teams to solve a larger puzzle. Each small team would solve their small projects (strawberry DNA, metal densities, chemical samples testing, and logic puzzles) to get a preliminary code. Once solved the solutions could be assembled into the numeric code ot unlock the briefcase. After opening the breifcase, the students were presented with one last task to stop a "rocket launch". The solution to the puzzle inside the breifcase was used to stop the timer from counting down. The briefcase itself was outfitted with custom 3D printed molds which were used to secured LCD Displays, numeric keypad, control circuit, and the battery. 

Ultimately, this project was a great success in helping us expose science and engineering to high school students. We hope to be able to create an updated version and visit more schools in the future!
